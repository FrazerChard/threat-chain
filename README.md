A Federated Quorum Blockchain Standardized Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing Application

This report presents a prototype for semi-decentralized federated Quorum blockchain-based
application that enables the upload, conversion and retrieval of cyber threat intelligence to
structured threat expressions, stored in a decentralised and distributed data store, enabling only the
permissioned users to interact with it. It was found that although the integrity and availability of the
process were improved immensely, the data confidentiality was found to be poorer due to a lack of
privacy-focused features.
